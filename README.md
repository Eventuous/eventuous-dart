This package is still in active development and not yet reached a stable version. 
Use it on your own risk. You should expect breaking changes that will require 
refactoring both code and behaviors of code depending on this package. When 
stable 1.0.0 is released, we pledge to keep the package backwards compatible 
within each major version. 

## Usage and documentation
